## About Me
Currently, I am a junior attending Clark Atlanta University with a biology major, with the career goal of becoming a physical therapist and hopefully opening my own holistic practice that offers services to underserved communities around the world. I am also very interested in biology research, and I hope to gain more hands-on experience. I'd love to do more lab work and be part of a major research study that aims to make a difference. I enjoy traveling and aspire to participate in international volunteer programs that offer resources, including health care, vaccinations, and medical treatment, to individuals in need in other countries.
