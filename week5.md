We accomplished a lot of stuff this week. One of our main focuses was getting our presentations ready for the high school students. We tried to craft it so that they could understand everything without using too much language and terminology that they were not familiar with. Being able to articulate our topic in a way that is engaging and can be easily understood. The biggest challenge we faced this week was managing to make our presentation last only 10 minutes. Keeping the presentation concise yet detailed was part of the challenge!
