This week, our goals were to download GIOANNI data for different locations and times using Python. We were able to complete this goal. Last week, we used the NASA Giovanni online software to find how PM2.5 changed over a span of 3 years, 10 years, and 20 years in Baltimore, Maryland. The data showed PM 2.5 levels increasing over time. We also expounded our knowledge on the fundamentals of AI and machine learning, such as what machine learning is, what types of machine learning there are, applications of machine learning, and the steps to implement a machine learning model. We received the asthma data and separated it by year (2008–2017) in Google spreadsheets. We also began working on our literature reviews. The goals we accomplished this week will lead to a productive and exciting week for our group the following week! This week, we were also able to release our helium balloon into the air to collect data on the air pollution in Baltimore, MD, on the Morgan State University campus. We also released our drone into the air just outside of the Calloway building to collect data on the air pollution in that area.
