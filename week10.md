This week was our last week on the CEAMLS summer internship. It's been an amazing experience so far, with ups and downs like any job or program. My team and I pushed through and got to experience real research and the integration of AI into research which I think will be the future. On Monday we made the last final touches to our PowerPoint and scientific paper. Tuesday was the presentation, which I felt went well. My group wen't third, with everyone performing exceptionally well and effectively representing Group 7, which was investigating the impact of air pollution on respiratory diseases in Baltimore using AI/ML technology. I walked away from this internship with gained knowledge of my topic but also with improved presentation skills and collaborative skills. I've learned the value of research and that it's not just about proving or disproving your hypothesis but about the process and exploring the various ways that your research can be conducted and the collaboration throughout the process.
