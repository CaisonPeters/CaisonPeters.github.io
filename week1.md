During the first week, I met with my research team and my mentors to discuss the project that I will be working on and gain an understanding of what kind of data and programming we will be doing. My group got to tour the lab and was shown the drones we will be using to gather data on air pollution in Baltimore. I also gained knowledge of Python and basic programming. I learned about what "physiological computing education" is, as well as the differences between EEG and EMG.
