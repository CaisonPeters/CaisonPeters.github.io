## About My Project



Problem: There is a lack of reasearch focusing how air pollutants are affecting respiratory linked illnesses specifically in Baltimore.

Approach: During this project, I will assist a team in looking at data to compare the concentrations of pollutants such as PM2.5 and others such as SO2 and respiratory related illnesses:

  - Capture satellite data from NASA Giovannib
 
  - Process data and classify them dates and regions in Baltimore 
  - Map output from physiological sensors to a physical robot. 

Expected Outcome: The project is expected to result in a conference poster presentation at the end of the DREU program.
